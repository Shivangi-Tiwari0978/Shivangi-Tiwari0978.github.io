The U.S. Public Health Service performed an experiment on African American men, or "Negro men," in Macon County, USA, between 1932 and 1972. The researchers observed the natural progression of untreated syphilis in 399 African American sharecroppers (plus 201 control subjects) who were largely illiterate and impoverished. They were given useless medication under the pretence of treating "bad blood," and they were then permitted to copulate in order to determine whether it was inherited. What was the name of this massive, immoral experiment?
