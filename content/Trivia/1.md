Here's the first question.
The Lepakshi temple in Andhra Pradesh, commonly known as the *“flying temple”* has a near life sized image of the deity Veerabhadra. Veerabhadra is a form of Shiva, created by his wrath, who upon hearing the self-immolation of his wife, throws a clump of his matted hair, giving rise to Veerabhadra. Who was Veerabhadra’s wife?
